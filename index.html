      <h1>2<sup>nd</sup> International Workshop on Digital Twin Engineering (DTE) 2023</h1>
      <h3>November 29, 2023, Technical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria, co-located with <a href="https://conferences.big.tuwien.ac.at/poem2023/">PoEM 2023</a></h3>
      <hr />
      <p>As to the growing interest in digital twins for planning and operating long-living cyber-physical assets, 
          the modeling community faces new challenges in developing applicable and profitable methodologies for engineering 
          and maintaining these virtual replicas of cyber-physical assets. However, the application of digital twins is not 
          limited to industrial domains; they are also capable of exploring and defining the most effective interventions for 
          large businesses and societal systems to achieve their operational, economic, and sustainability-related objectives 
          (e.g., Gemini principles). The difficulty in conceiving a digital twin lies in its inherent complexity, which already 
          necessitates advanced engineering. A solution is to work closely with industrial and economic stakeholders to develop 
          application scenarios that drive the development of digital twins by providing a foundation for requirements elicitation. 
          In this manner, future attempts to conceive digital twins will not fall prey to the curse of complexity, as COTS solutions 
          frankly cannot do the job.</p>
      <p>Our workshop aims to address the following central issues:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Design of collaboration platforms to enable the joint engineering and maintenance of cyber-physical asset virtual replicas.</li>
            <li>Integration of system modeling, AI, and simulation as fundamental digital twin building blocks.</li>
            <li>Life cycle management and maintenance of digital twins in symbiosis with their cyber-physical assets.</li>
            <li>Continuous quality assurance for cyber-physical assets through digital twin monitoring, testing, and control.</li>
            <li>The modeling of socio-techno-economic characteristics of large business and societal systems, including uncertainty, dynamism, and emergentism in space and time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a result of the ongoing digitalization of our society and industry, the purpose of this workshop is to discuss the current status of 
        digital twin engineering and emerging application areas.</p>
