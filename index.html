      <h1>1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Digital Twin Engineering</h1>
        <h3>June <sup>7th</sup>, 2022, KU Leuven, co-located with <a href="https://caise22.ugent.be/">CAiSE 2022</a></h3>
        <hr />
        <p>As of the growing interest in gestating digital twins for planning and operating long-living,
          complex cyber-physical assets, information systems research is now faced with new
          challenges to develop applicable and profitable methodologies and frameworks for
          engineering and maintaining these virtual replicas of cyber-physical assets for various
          industrial domains (automotive, construction, systems engineering or facility management).
          However, the application of digital twins is not restricted to engineering and related
          domains. Digital twins also bear the capacity of exploring and defining right interventions for
          large businesses and societal systems to achieve their operational, economical and
          sustainability related goals (e.g., Gemini principles) over time. The crux in gestating a digital
          twin however lies in its inherent complexity which hence already demands for sophisticated
          engineering by itself. A potential remedy lies in tight collaboration with industrial and
          economic stakeholders for devising tangible application scenarios to drive the actual
          gestation of digital twins by providing a basis for practical requirements elicitation. Only this
          way can future attempts towards gestating digital twins avoid falling victim to the curse of
          complexity as COTS approaches frankly cannot do the job. However, we also believe that
          current research has reached a state that provides the relevant enabling technologies for
          gestating digital twins. To thoroughly examine current needs and demands from industry
          and economy in correlation with current opportunities from academia and research towards
          this long-term vision, we we aim at addressing the following central issues with
          our workshop:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Design of collaboration platforms for enabling the joint engineerin and maintenance
              of virtual replicas of cyber-physical assets</li>
            <li>Integration of system modelling, AI, and simulation as central building blocks for
              digital twins</li>
            <li>Long-term maintenance and life cycle management of digital twins in symbiosis with
              their cyber-physical assets</li>
            <li>Continuous quality assurance for cyber-physical assets by monitoring, testing and
              control through digital twins</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
